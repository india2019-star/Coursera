                            Food is usually of plant or animal origin, and contains essential nutrients, 
                            such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is 
                            ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy,
                            maintain life, or stimulate growth.Today, the majority of the food energy required by
                            the ever-increasing population of the world is supplied by the food industry. Food safety 
                            and food security are monitored by agencies like the International Association for Food Protection, 
                            World Resources Institute, World Food Programme, Food and Agriculture Organization, and International
                            Food Information Council. They address issues such as sustainability, biological diversity, climate 
                            change, nutritional economics, population growth, water supply, and access to food.
                            The right to food is a human right derived from the International Covenant 
                            on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), recognizing the "right to an 
                            adequate standard of living, including adequate food", as well as the "fundamental 
                            right to be free from hunger".Many plants and plant parts are eaten as food and around 2,000 plant 
                            species are cultivated for food. Many of these plant species have several distinct cultivars.[7]
                            Seeds of plants are a good source of food for animals, including humans, because they contain the 
                            nutrients necessary for the plant's initial growth, including many healthful fats, such as omega fats.
